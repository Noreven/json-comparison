# JSON Directory Diff

This Python project allows you to compare JSON files within a directory tree and identify the differences between them. It recursively traverses the directory structure, locating JSON files, and performs a detailed comparison to highlight variations in their content.

## Features

- Recursively walks through a directory tree and identifies JSON files.
- Compares the JSON files within the directory tree to find differences.
- Provides a detailed report highlighting the variations between JSON files.
- Supports nested JSON structures.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Noreven/json-comparison.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd json-comparison
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Usage

The script `app.py` is used to compare JSON files within a directory tree.

```shell
python json_diff.py [directory1] [directory2]
```

Replace `[directory1]` [directory2]` with the path to the root directories containing the JSON files you want to compare. If no directory is provided, the script will default to the current working directory.

The script will compare all the JSON files it finds and generate a report that highlights the differences between them.

## Output Format

By default, the script outputs the differences between the JSON files in a csv file with 6 attributes.

## Example

To illustrate the usage of this script, let's consider the following directory structure:

```
.
├── dir1
│   └── file1.json
└── dir2
    └── file1.json
```
